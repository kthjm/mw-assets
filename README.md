> Grunt is terrific. It is used by many thousands of projects, and deservedly so. But it's not a build tool - it's a task runner. It says so right on the homepage!
>
> A build tool takes a set of source files and somehow converts them into files that are suitable for distribution - transpiling them, minifying them, concatenating them, and doing whatever else is necessary to take your mountain of CoffeeScript and Sass files and turn them into something that people can use. Think of a build tool as a chef, taking a set of ingredients and turning them into a meal.
>
>A task runner is more generic - a task could mean anything from linting your JavaScript, to running your test suite, to deploying the finished product to S3. It so happens that those tasks could include build tasks, but it doesn't mean a task runner is a build tool. Think of a task runner as a butler, taking your instructions and passing them onto their staff, handling all the complex logistics and coordination.
>
>So next time you read an article comparing Grunt to Gulp, or another build tool, remember that it's comparing a butler to a chef!
